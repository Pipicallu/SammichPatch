# [SammichPatch](https://sammichpatch.herokuapp.com/)

Have you ever been sat at your desk, at home? or at the office? Perhaps you were simply day dreaming or maybe even brainstorming your next 
big idea, when all of a sudden as if seemingly out of nowhere... THE CRAVING HITS! And as if by magic all your thoughts past, present and 
future are instantly replaced with and insatiable hunger that until quenched will not release you from its buns (excuse the pun).
In my case that craving was a sandwich. Not just any sandwich, but it had to be the perfect sandwich, with all the fixins, fillings
and just the right selection of cheese. That's when I knew that the answer to my MS4 project wasn't in my head but as with most of 
the important decisions I've undertaken in my short tenure as an adult, it was most definitely a gut feeling. 

That was when the idea for SammichPatch was born. A web app that brings the experience of subway-esque sandwich making to the digital space
allowing our users to brave the crave and create their own perfect lunchtime snack, everytime. Our SammichPatch menu allows you to choose from
a diverse list of premium quality ingredients across a range of dietary requirements, offering something for everyone. Your creation can then be
paired with a choice of drink and side, rounding it out to a full lunchtime experience. The site allows for secure checkout using stripe, as well
as the ability for users to create accounts to save delivery information as well as view their past orders. Users may also edit their order and remove 
items from their bag. The site owner is provided with the ability to add, update or remove products from the site, as well as viewing the full order
customer order history, in the django admin.
