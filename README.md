## A brief origin story.
Have you ever been sat at your desk, at home? or at the office? Perhaps you were simply day dreaming or maybe even brainstorming your next 
big idea, when all of a sudden as if seemingly out of nowhere... THE CRAVING HITS! And as if by magic all your thoughts past, present and 
future are instantly replaced with and insatiable hunger that until quenched will not release you from its buns (excuse the pun).
In my case that craving was a sandwich. Not just any sandwich, but it had to be the perfect sandwich, with all the fixins, fillings
and just the right selection of cheese. That's when I knew that the answer to my MS4 project wasn't in my head but as with most of 
the important decisions I've undertaken in my short tenure as an adult, it was most definitely a gut feeling. 

And so the idea for SammichPatch was born. A web app that brings the experience of subway-esque sandwich making to the digital space
allowing our users to brave the crave and create their own perfect lunchtime snack, everytime. Our SammichPatch menu allows you to choose from
a diverse list of premium quality ingredients across a range of dietary requirements, offering something for everyone. Your creation can then be
paired with a choice of drink and side, rounding it out to a full lunchtime experience. The site allows for secure checkout using stripe, as well
as the ability for users to create accounts to save delivery information as well as view their past orders. Users may also edit their order and remove 
items from their bag. The site owner is provided with the ability to add, update or remove products from the site, as well as viewing the full order
customer order history, in the django admin. A lot of love and effort was put into the making of this app. I certainly hope it comes across to you.

# UX

### User Stories.	
- As a User, I want to be able to understand the site's purpose without forfeiting any information.
- As a User, I want to navigate the site easily and in the simplest most intuitive way possible.
- As a User, I want to use the main Form to build my sandwich and see my items added to the cart.
- As a User, I wan't the categories of that main form to give me an indication of whether or not I have selected a cretain category of ingredient when building my sandwich.
- As a User, I want a diverse list of ingredients to choose from 
- As a User, I want to sort my ingredients by dietry Requrement. If any.
- As a User, I want to see my order in a cart before purchase to change or delete any mistakes made.
- As a User, I want to have a selection of sides and drinks to round out my order.
- As a User, I want to be able to see my order total.
- As a User, I want to be able to checkout and pay securley.
- As a User, I want to have an account where I can save both my delivery info as well as see my past orders

### Site owner goals.

As the site owner who sees the value in my own creation I too feel as though I would want to be a user of this site.
So many of my choices as a site owner were made with the user purposefully in mind. 

Below are the main questions I asked myself throughout the development process:

- Is this obvious to the user? - specifically when dealing with the overal interactivity of the site and presentation of information,
  I.E. how easy is it to get from A to B? are the visual and navigational choices delightful? Does the site react in a way that is intuative to the user? Does it relate to/re-create a real life model or experience?
  more specifically - can I as a user recgonise where I am, how I got here and what options I have presented to me here on out?
- Is it pretty? - Does the overall UI look inviting? is there an obvious theme or color scheme? Is it attractive to my users, do they engage with the pictures and images used?
  Is the information displayed in a spaced out fashion? Is it distinguishible from other pieces of information? Is it pleasurable to the eye? Can it be retained at a glance? Will I need to remember where to go the next time I visit? 
- Is it interactive? - Does the site offer  visual queues to the user? Are the responses timely? Do they add to the understanding of the user? Do they add to the interactivity of the user and add weight to the users choices? Are their points where the site is susceptible to lag or inefficancy?
- Is it purposeful? - Am I building something enjoyable? Does it offer incentive to return? Is it a pleasure to use? Is it convenient?  Have I built the site in a way that helps the user fullfill the desired need?

Here are the site specific conclusions to the questions asked:

- As a Site Owner, I want my users to be able to securely and easily check out their products.
- As a Site Owner, I want to offer a visually appealing application that is gives my users confidence in the quality of my products.
- As a Site Owner, I want my users to understand how to correctly make use of my site from the landing page alone.
- As a Site Owner, I want to be able to edit and modify my site and its ingredients/items when required.
- As a Site Owner, I want to view an order history so as to track the performance of my business over time.


# Design & Colours

The approach here was a minimalist theme that took on adornments reminicent of those old 50's American diners, with the paper menus and double borders.
The logo itself was also designed to look rustic and classic in nature, and the choices of brown for the backgrounds of products and text coupled, 
with the light green borders for menus and forms were put in place with the hope of accenting the quality of the products and ingredients. In short 
I wanted the site to be reflective of finding ones-self at a diner or bakery or caf√©.


### Colour Palette:

### Icons

- All icons were sourced from SVGREPO (https://www.svgrepo.com/), 
as they provide an assorment of multicoloured icons that provided 
stark contrast to the otherwise minimal aesthetic I went for with
the colour palette.



### Typography

As Always the font choice needed to be specific. The all caps font Halva fit perfectly,
As it reminded me of those neon signs one would see at a classic restaurant or diner.
It felt instantly thematic and on brand and is used in both the bold and regular font weight
for titles and body text respectively. The font is available for download in the 
assets folder of this project. It is also deployed locally as google fonts don't seem to have
it freely available.

### Wireframes

For this project I used <a href= "https://www.figma.com/">figma</a> as a free online tool to complete my wireframes.
Its Easy to use navigation had me creating high fidelity wireframes and concepts within minutes.
I also used it as an editing tool to design my logo from scratch.
You can find all my wireframes here including the original concepts that were eventually refined to what the project looks like today.
